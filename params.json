{"name":"Giggle-laugh","tagline":"","body":"I'm a senior in high school and I love math and science classes. Some of my interests would be that I would like to go to DePaul University and major in computer science. When I have free time, I like to watch/play sports and listen to music. My favorite sport would probably be basketball. I have a twin sister as you can see in the photo to the right. I like to watch scary movies, even though I get scared easily.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
