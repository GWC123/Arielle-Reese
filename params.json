Some of my interests would be that I would like to go to DePaul University and major in computer science. When I have free time, I like to watch/play sports and listen to music. My favorite sport would probably be basketball. I have a twin sister as you can see in the photo above. I like to watch scary movies, even though I get scared easily.\r\n\r\n## Girls Who Projects##\r\n### Jackson Pollock\r\n![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=0ByVvkquR7JJrSVhIOWlFNmtLUXM).\r\n\r\n[Click This Link To See My Favorite Brand](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/)\r\n\r\n[Click Here To Enter My Basketball Court!!](http://arreese16.github.io/Arielle/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
